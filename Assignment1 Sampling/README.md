Assignment 1 : Sampling 

Overview 

This project analyzes the impact of different sampling techniques on machine learning model performance when dealing with imbalanced credit card fraud detection datasets. The assignment demonstrates how various sampling strategies can improve model accuracy in real-world applications.

Methodology

Input(Dataset used): Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
1. Data Balancing

Downloaded the imbalanced credit card dataset
Applied balancing techniques to create a balanced dataset

2. Sampling Techniques (5 Different Methods)
The following sampling techniques were implemented:

Sampling1 - Simple Random Sampling

Sampling2 - Systematic Sampling

Sampling3 - Stratified Sampling

Sampling4 - Cluster Sampling

Sampling5 - Bootstrap Sampling

Sampling6 - Cross Fold Validation Sampling 

3. Machine Learning Models (5 Different Models)
Five ML models were trained and evaluated:

M1 - Logistic Regression

M2 - Decision Tree

M3 - Random Forest

M4 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

M5 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Best Model: Ramdom Forest
